# Description of the project
Wheat Spindle Streak Mosaic Virus (WSSMV), that infects durum wheat due to a fungal vector : Polymyxa graminis (P.graminis), represents a worldwide threat for crop productivity of this essential cereal. Currently, there is no available solution to combat the virus and its vector. The major lead is to genetically combat the disease. To do so, more knowledge must be gained about the genome of the different actors of the disease. Therefore, in this paper we develop a method to increase the amount of P.graminis DNA in samples designed for sequencing. We will use a series of filters, centrifugations and chemical treatments to isolate the resting spores of P.graminis. Intermediate verifications will help to improve the protocol. Finally, to be able to evaluate our method we will use DNA quantification methods to know if the method really increases the percentage of DNA in the sample.
